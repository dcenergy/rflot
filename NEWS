* No more data.table dependency.  This introduces a breaking change in the way
  the extra.cols argument is presented in JS when using a data.frame vs.
  data.table as the data source.  In particular previously

  extr.cols = list(dt, class)

  would have been accessible at 

  extra_data[index]['dt'], and extra_data[index]['class'].

  Now, with data.frame as the source of underlying data, can be found at

  extr_data[index][0], and extra_data[index][1].
