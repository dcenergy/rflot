rflot 0.1.499
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Users can now specify a chart title using
    flotOptions(...,title=list(...))

* Bugfix: When dodging and stacking bar charts at the same time (using stack=T
  together with bars.order), fix instances of incorrect stacking in the case of
  more than 3 series stacked in same (dodged) position.

* Allow users to specify that a series should not appear in the legend, by 
  passing NULL for the label parameter.  In the case of a grouped series, this
  will remove all groups in that series from the legend.  For more granular
  control, use legend.labelFormatter JS callback.


rflot 0.1.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* No more data.table dependency.  This introduces a breaking change in the way
  the extra.cols argument is presented in JS when using a data.frame vs.
  data.table as the data source.  In particular previously

  extr.cols = list(dt, class)

  would have been accessible at 

  extra_data[index]['dt'], and extra_data[index]['class'].

  Now, with data.frame as the source of underlying data, can be found at

  extr_data[index][0], and extra_data[index][1].
